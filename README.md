# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  The purpose of this analysis is to be able to create an interactive webpage that allows us to search the data for specific characteristics. This allows us to see the data in an easily readable format, as well as have the ability to easily and quickly comb through the data.

## Results:
### Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
  By entering information into one of the search fields, we can gather results that match that field. For example if we wanted to look at only sightings in CA, we do can do so by enter "ca" into the State search field and our results show up with all sightings in CA.

## Summary:
### In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
  One drawback is that there is a lot of data that initially shows up on the page and overall the page is not aesthetically pleasing as it could be. One thing I would recommend would be putting in a scroll bar. This would help with the overall size of the page by condensing the results into a scrollbox. Another suggestion would be to have a "total results" field to be able to count how many results show up during the search criteria. As this data grows the results will only get larger and can be a bit of inconvenience if not addressed.
